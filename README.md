# SOCIAL MEDIA DASHBOARD

## User Stories

As a user,this social media platform should help you navigate with ease over the dashboard.
The dashboard should offer options of updating personal information with just a click of a few buttons.
It should also take in comments from other users providing interactiveness.

## MVP's

1:Use react components that ensure reusability and offer future improvement.
2:The App should contain form data which is dynamic using state.
3:Pieces of code representing a functionality should be build seperately in indivudual component for ease of debuging and version control.
4.Data fetching with functions such as useEffect,and manipulation of data(iteration) by use of .map mathod.
5.The dash should be appealing and welcoming with simple but classic features by use of css features such as tailwindcss or bootstrap.
6.All the essential parts of a webpage to be working perfectly eg header,body and footer sections well differentiated.work done
